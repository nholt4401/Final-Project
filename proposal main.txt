# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mario Shooter

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This is a platform game based off of mario that will allow you to shoot projectiles at your enemies.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We plan on using the base mario and the pong projectiles and AI to make the game. It will allow you to run through a normal mario level all the while having the ability to shoot projectiles at enemies. 
Our software will create a game with multiple levels that have numerous enemies and they will have the ability to return fire. We hope that we can establish more than one level to play through.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

One full level that allows you to run through and shoot the enemies.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

One full level that allows you to go through and shoot the enemies while they shoot back at you.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

2 or more full levels and full game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First we need to create mario then add projectiles and enemies to it and understand how to code our game using the libraries for game dev.
